# Implantify
 
Implantify is a Rimworld ~~kludge~~ mod that adds new scenario part that allows you to select more health conditions in scenario editor without manually editing each pawn. It was created for personal purposes, since I could not find another alternative.  
This mod ***can't*** add ***any*** health condition to ***any*** race but still can do more than vanilla "Forced health conditions".  
  
You are free to use this repository to make better forks of this mod, but please let me know if you publish it as I want to use a better version of this mod too.

## 1.4 Update
Added recipes scanning to find allowed body parts. Now even more health conditions can be applied!
- tested on **Dojutsu Naruto** and **\[RH2\] Faction: V.O.I.D.**
- 1.3 and 1.4 versions now have the same functionality

## Mod load order
You can load this mod in any order you want

## Known issues
- Some health conditions will not apply at all
- Sometimes health conditions may be added to your pawns in the selection menu, but disappear after the game starts.
- Some health conditions may break your scenario editor until you remove that scenario part and add it again.
